# Demographic History of Snakes

This repository contains the code used to run PSMC analyses and process the output.
Data processing scripts were written for use on Adelaide University's HPC Phoenix,
which utilises the submission management system SLURM. The R-scripts were run on
a local machine where the PSMC results (and accessory files) were stored.

The `plots` directory contains the figures used in the main text and supplementary
material. There is no guarantee that all figures found in these directories made
their way into the final text.

The `results` directory simply contains an `Rdata` objects that stored the aggregated
PSMC results across samples and clock intervals. The tables used in the main text
are also stored here.
