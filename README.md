# Demographic History of Snakes

This repository contains the code used to run PSMC analyses and process the output.
Data processing scripts were written for use on Adelaide University's HPC Phoenix,
which utilises the submission management system SLURM. The R-scripts were run on
a local machine where the PSMC results (and accessory files) were stored.
